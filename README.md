# 📊 AdventureWorks BI Dashboard (using Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project is a business intelligence case study built using the **AdventureWorks dataset**, where I worked as a Business Intelligence / Data Analyst to design an interactive Power BI dashboard for management-level reporting.

The focus of this project was not just visualization, but understanding business requirements and converting raw transactional data into insights that support decision-making.

## Business Context
AdventureWorks is a global manufacturing fictional company producing cycling equipment and accessories. The management team required a centralized dashboard to monitor overall business performance, compare regional results, analyze product-level trends, and understand customer behavior.

The input data was provided in the form of multiple raw CSV files covering sales transactions, products, customers, orders, returns, and sales territories.

## What I Worked On
Using **Power BI Desktop**, I:
- Connected and transformed raw data using Power Query  
- Built a relational data model to support analysis  
- Created calculated columns and measures using DAX  
- Designed a **4-page interactive dashboard**, which can be reused as a reporting template  

The dashboard structure is kept generic so it can be adapted easily for similar business scenarios.

## Dashboard Highlights
The report includes multiple pages focusing on:
- High-level KPIs such as sales, revenue, profit, and returns  
- Regional and territory-level performance comparison  
- Product and category-level analysis  
- Customer insights to identify high-value customers  

Interactive filters allow users to explore data dynamically without changing the underlying model.

## Learning Outcome
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of end-to-end BI development, including data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design focused on business questions rather than just visuals.

---

## Project Access
This repository contains:
- Power BI `.pbix` file (dashboard template)
- Dataset files
- Dashboard screenshots

Due to Power BI Service limitations, the dashboard is shared as a PBIX file along with images.
